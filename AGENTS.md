# Graphon

Object storage with search your coding agent can set up, fill, query, and wire into your app.

Activate the `graphon` skill for any storage work. It names the interface
to use and how to find the Graphon CLI.

These rules hold here, whether or not the `graphon` skill loaded:

- Do not print, echo, or paste an API key.
- When a shell exists, create an app key only with `graphon api-keys create`,
  and send the key to a file with `--write-env <path>` or pipe it into the
  project's secret manager. Never let the key reach the terminal. The
  `create_api_key` MCP tool puts the key in the transcript.
- Do not commit a `.env` file.
- Use the lowest role that does the job: `viewer`, then `editor`, then `admin`.
- Do not delete a bucket, an object, or source data unless the user asked for
  that exact delete in this session.

The `graphon` skill explains what Graphon is, which interface to use, and how
to find the CLI. Load it with the Skill tool, not by reading its file.

## When you cannot continue

Each row below is a full stop. Say the sentence in the right column, then end
your turn. Do not run another command, and do not look for a way around it. A
blocked task that reports clearly is a good outcome; the user can unblock it
in seconds once they know what is wrong.

| When this happens | Say this, then stop |
| --- | --- |
| The Graphon CLI is missing and the install command fails | "I could not install the Graphon CLI. The installer exited with `<code>`: `<message>`." |
| `graphon whoami` fails twice | "I cannot confirm your Graphon login. Please run `graphon login` and tell me when it finishes." |
| No MCP tool and no Graphon CLI is available | "This session has no way to reach Graphon. Install the plugin's MCP server, or install the Graphon CLI." |
| The Graphon MCP server is listed but not signed in | "The Graphon MCP server is not signed in. Please authenticate it from your agent's MCP panel, then ask me again." |
| Five commands have run with no progress | "I am not making progress on this. Here is what I tried and what each command returned: `<list>`." |

The fourth row has one extra rule, because the mistake is easy to make and
costly. **Do not finish the job with the CLI instead.** The CLI can hold a
different account and a different environment, so the work would land
somewhere the user does not expect, and they would not be told.

Never do any of these, in any Graphon skill. When one of them is the only way
forward, that is a stop: say so and end your turn.

- Read, copy, print, or decode a credentials or token file, including anything
  under `~/.config/graphon/`. A token is a secret even when the user owns it.
  Say "I cannot inspect your stored credentials" and stop.
- Change permissions or ownership of any file or folder.
- Go looking through Graphon's own source, tests, or seed data to work around
  a failure. Reading the user's project to do the job they asked for is normal;
  reverse-engineering Graphon to get past an error is not.
- Try a second way to do something that just failed. One attempt, then report.
- Guess at an environment variable, a flag, or a config path that this skill
  does not name. If the skill does not name it, it does not exist.
